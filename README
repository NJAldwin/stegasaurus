==== Usage ====
Since it is written in python, all that is needed to make sure the program is runnable is to ensure that the file "stegan" in the project directory is executable (execute "chmod +x stegan" if not). Then, to encode, run
    ./stegan --encode <carrier> <message> <output>
Where <carrier> is the filename of the WAV file you'd like to encode into, <message> is the file you'd like to encode into the carrier file, and <output> is the file you'd like the program to output the new encoded file to. To decode, run
    ./stegan --decode <decode> <extraction>
where <decode> is the file that should have the message encoded in it and <extraction> is the desired filename for the decoded message itself.

==== Notes ====
 - Our software relies on the Python standard library, the NumPy scientific computing suite, and the LAME audio encoder/decoder.

==== Changelog ====
2012-04-13: (Version 0.03)
  - Improved embedding process such that we can do from mp3/wav to mp3/wav and resulting files are more steganographic
2012-03-01: Rapid prototype mark 2 for Assignment 5 (Version 0.02)
  - Added mp3 conversion
  - Converted embedding process to FFT-based instead of raw PCM
  - Cleaned up code, added more error messages
2012-02-17: Rapid prototype for Assignment 1 (Version 0.01)
