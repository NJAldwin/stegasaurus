==== Usage ====
Since it is written in python, all that is needed to make sure the program is runnable is to ensure that the file "stegan" in the project directory is executable (execute "chmod +x stegan" if not). Then, to encode, run
    ./stegan --encode <carrier> <message> <output>
Where <carrier> is the filename of the WAV file you'd like to encode into, <message> is the file you'd like to encode into the carrier file, and <output> is the file you'd like the program to output the new encoded file to. To decode, run
    ./stegan --decode <decode> <extraction>
where <decode> is the file that should have the message encoded in it and <extraction> is the desired filename for the decoded message itself.

==== Notes ====
 - Our software will convert input mp3 files to wav and embed steganographic information. The files will be left in wav format, conversion back to mp3 will be added in a future release
 - Our software relies on the Python standard library, the NumPy scientific computing suite, and the LAME audio encoder/decoder.

==== Changelog ====
