==== Usage ====
Since it is written in python, all that is needed to make sure the program is runnable is to ensure that the file "stegan" in the project directory is executable (execute "chmod +x stegan" if not). Then, to encode, run
    ./stegan --encode <carrier> <message> <output>
Where <carrier> is the filename of the WAV file you'd like to encode into, <message> is the file you'd like to encode into the carrier file, and <output> is the file you'd like the program to output the new encoded file to. To decode, run
    ./stegan --decode <decode> <extraction>
where <decode> is the file that should have the message encoded in it and <extraction> is the desired filename for the decoded message itself.

==== Notes ====
 - At the moment our software only works with WAV files (MP3 support will be included in future versions of the software)
 - Our software relies on the Python standard library (in the future, it will also depend on the NumPy scientific computing suite)

==== Changelog ====
